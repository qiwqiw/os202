# Top 10 Lists: Week 04

[Home](../)

BTW: Starting this week, I will mix both Indonesian and English (I hope I understand Simlish but I don’t) on my Top 10 List as I sometime struggle to paraphrase the article to one paragraph of Simple English. I will try to avoid Wikipedia as academics find it not a reliable source.
1.	[Hardware Protection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hardware-protection-and-type-of-hardware-protection/)<br>
This is the way for PC/device to protect the hardware component of the device, divided into three types of it.
[CPU Protection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hardware-protection-and-type-of-hardware-protection/)<br>
CPU Protection works by protecting CPU from continuous usage of CPU by a process. This protection is using timer that when the time’s up, the timer will send a signal to terminate the process from the CPU
2.	[Memory Protection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hardware-protection-and-type-of-hardware-protection/)<br>
It works with two registers, Bare register that store starting address of a process; and Limit register that store the size of it. 
3.	[I/O Protection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hardware-protection-and-type-of-hardware-protection/)<br>
This will prevent some occurances (such as: Termination of I/O, View other process’ I/O, and giving priority to some process of I/O) by forcing process to access the I/O through system call to be monitored.
4.	[Memory Allocation](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27492/memory-allocation)<br>
Memory Allocation is a process which a device use some or more part of unused memory for program execution. This memory will be reserved until the program is finish and released to free some memory. It has two types of core: Static and Dynamic Memory Allocation.
5.	[Fragmentation](http://docs.raxco.com/perfectdisk/12/en/What_is_Fragmentation.htm)<br>
Secara umum berdasarkan kamus Oxford, artinya adalah proses pembagian menjadi potongan-potongan kecil atau terpisah. Namun, dalam masalah computing, fragmentasi adalah kegiatan dimana sebuah file dipecah menjadi banyak bagian kecil yang disebar ke seluruh disk. Kelemahan dari fragmentasi adalah memakan ruang kerja sistem yang cukup besar sehingga dapat menurunkan performa komputer secara drastic.
6.	[Logical Address](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-logical-and-physical-address-wrt-operating-system)<br>
Also known as Virtual Address, Logical Address is an address generated by CPU without any physical address, but used as reference to access physical address. This is one of the components to make a physical address with help of base address loaded from MMU.
7.	[Physical Address](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/13036/physical-address)<br>
A Physical Address is a real street address that you can use for business or personal use. Because Physical Addresses are real street.. wait this is wrong. <br>
Physical Address, known also as binary or real address, is the location of memory inside main memory, used by hardware and software (through virtual address) for accessing data.
8.	[Memory Management Unit (MMU)](https://staff.ui.ac.id/system/files/users/moningka/material/memory-1.pdf)<br>
MMU is a hardware to connect logical address to physical address. 
9.	[Dynamic Linking](https://kb.iu.edu/d/akqn)<br>
Dynamic linking is accomplished by placing the name of a sharable library in the executable image. Actual linking with the library routines does not occur until the image is run, when both the executable and the library are placed in memory. An advantage of dynamic linking is that multiple programs can share a single copy of the library.
10.	[Static Linking](https://kb.iu.edu/d/akqn)<br>
Static linking is the result of the linker copying all library routines used in the program into the executable image. This may require more disk space and memory than dynamic linking, but is both faster and more portable, since it does not require the presence of the library on the system where it is run.
